# Challenge

I just moved into a new place and I have an extra monitor. I was thinking I could get updates on what's going on in the world. I'd be the only user so you don't have to worry about permissions or accounts or things like that, but I imagine I'll change my mind about what sites I want to be pulling from over time so hopefully we build something that makes that relatively painless to do.

## Getting started
  1. npm install
  2. [Ignore me!] ... Open up 2 terminal windows/tabs
  3. [Ignore me!] ... ```npm run server``` - this spins up the server where you can make the api call
  4. ```npm start``` - this starts up the frontend and opens a new tab in the browser

## [Ignore me!] ... Changing the server?
  ```
  $ npm run test-server
  ```

## [Ignore me!] ... Access the news api
  ```
  http://localhost:4444/api/news
  ```
